This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, posted on Brights pace.

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue TAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

			<h2>Progress Report/Engineering Project Journal for Yusuf Jarada</h2>

			<br><br>
			<b>Date Reported:</b> -1/26/24-<br>
			<b>Start Time:</b> -10am-<br>
			<b>Work Time:</b> -3hrs-<br>

			This week I mostly worked on the algorithms with Max and tried to brainstorm new solutions to the dodging
			problem. I also continued to work on the embedded code but have made little progress on it. Overall,
			this was a really slow week, and not much was done. We all made a bit of progress on our tasks but no
			breakthroughs yet. I will likely put the embedded work on the back burner for a bit and really dial in to
			help Max with the code as I feel that it would be a better use of my time and skills. I will also work on
			the CAD models for the actual robot this weekend and will update next week's journal with that progress.
			I also want to get help with the embedded communications from the TAs and Joe next week. ManLab was
			canceled, and we really could have used some guidance on the communications tasks.

			Today I looked at microcontroller selection, and we have decided to check out an F7 board, so we can use
			EtherCAT protocol to control our motors. I then worked on bring up the board, so we could deploy code to
			it. I tried to set up UART on the nucleo board, but I did not make that much progress. I will try to ask
			the TAs more about it at a later time. Below are some Photos for what I did today.

			<p>This week we finalized our PSDRs as well as worked on the skeleton of our project. I personally worked on
				electrical component selections, CAD models
				and finished the first version of our object tracking software. Below are pictures of the CAD
				models:</p>

			I also worked on a preliminary PCB design which looked at the connectors we would use to mount the F0 board.
			This
			design and connector have become obsolete since we have changed our components since then.

			As team lead, I worked to oversee the rest of my teams' progress and aided them in whatever they were
			working on. I provided a skeleton code for image tracking with one color, this allowed my teammate max to
			expand upon the code and extend the code to two-object tracking using K-Means clustering. I also worked
			with Ayman on the electro-mechaincal part of the project. We ran through some calculations for the torque
			requirments, and this informed our design and component selection. I also talked a lot with Chuck and Joe
			about our design and component selection. Finally, we met with the department head on Thursday to propose
			our project and try to get the money we need for the motors that meet our design requirements.

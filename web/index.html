			<h2>Project Name: PunchBot 2.0</h2>
			<h2>Project Description:</h2>
			<p>
				PunchBot 2.0 introduces an immersive user interface to the exciting world of dodging punches. Our
				primary objective is to create a dynamic single-unit target attached to an axle, offering 2 degrees
				of freedom for seamless dodging maneuvers. Equipped with advanced cameras to track glove motions in
				real-time, it is designed to predict and skillfully evade incoming punches, delivering an engaging
				and entertaining experience for kids.

					Document the design, code, and testing procedures, focusing on user-centric aspects for future
					enhancements or improvements.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Project Specific Design Requirements (PSDRs):</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>[Software]: An ability to track a punch and robot in the environment space by implementing
					computer vision on two cameras connected to a jetson nano. The connection and refresh rate of the
					script should be continually fast enough to record and process 0.5s of footage at a time with a
					50ms delay.
				</li>
				<li>
					[Software]: An ability to generate the best possible dodge solution from a given punch. To
					accomplish this, we must generate a predicted trajectory and then generate instructions for the
					motors to dodge in the opposite direction. This must be within 5% of the fastest as possible given
					the circumstance, then return to the center when we detect the punch has been retracted.
				</li>
				<li>
					[Hardware]: An ability to translate a set of coordinates into motor-specific torque values to
					control the proper robot path. Using EtherCAD, we must be able to convert our directions into
					hardware-specific serial commands that will accurately guide PunchBot as it actuates in the real
					world.
				</li>
				<li>
					[Hardware]: An ability to supply a constant 5V and 3.3V to the microcontrollers and peripherals
					of the logic system at varying current demands.
				</li>
				<li>[Hardware]: An ability to communicate motor command data between both microcontrollers.</li>

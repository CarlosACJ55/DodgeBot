            <h2>Project Name: PunchBot</h2>
            <h2>Project Description:</h2>
            <p>PunchBot has a simple goal: dodging your punches. The main goal is to build a single unit target
                attached to an axle that will allow it to pivot with 2 degrees of freedom. Combined with a cameras to
                see and predict the gloves' motions, this robot is supposed to predict and dodge all incoming
                punches to serve mainly as an entertaining game for kids.</p>

                    camera input and control motors.
                </li>
                <li>Ensure it has the necessary processing power and interfaces for camera and motor control.</li>

                <li>Identify and track the position of the brightly-colored gloves in real-time.</li>
            </ul>
            Control Algorithm:
            <ul>
                <li>Create a control algorithm that takes input from the image processing module.</li>
                <li>Implement a dodging strategy based on the detected glove positions.</li>
            </ul>
            Motor Control:

                <li>Write code to control the motors based on the output from the control algorithm.</li>
                <li>Ensure the robot can move quickly and accurately to dodge punches.</li>
            </ul>
            Integration and Testing:
            <ul>
                <li>Integrate the hardware and software components.</li>
                <li>Test the prototype in controlled environments to ensure accurate glove detection and effective
                    dodging.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Refinement:
            <ul>
                <li>Refine the algorithms and adjust parameters based on testing results.</li>
                <li>Fine-tune the robot's movements for better-dodging performance.</li>

            <h2>Project Specific Design Requirements (PSDRs):</h2>
            These are the five Design Requirements where we
            capture your team engineering design effort (the rest of your project may consist of off-the-shelf
            hardware and software), and these 5 PSDRs are worth 8% of your teams final grade. The First Draft is from
            your Final Project Proposal, and you may change your PSDRs at will over the first 5 weeks of the course.
            At least three must be hardware PSDRs (indicate). Delete this text and only list your 5 PSDRs.
            <ol>
                <li>PSDR #1 (Software): An ability to track a punch and robot in the environment space.</li>
                <li>PSDR #2 (Software): An ability to create a set of coordinates that place the robots outside a punch
                    trajectory path
                </li>
                <li>PSDR #3 (Hardware): An ability to translate a set of coordinates into motor-specific torque values
                    to control the proper robot path.
                </li>
                <li>PSDR #4 (Hardware): An ability to supply a constant 5V and 3.3V to the microcontrollers and
                    peripherals of the logic system at varying current demands.
                </li>
                <li>PSDR #5 (Hardware): An ability to communicate motor command data between both microcontrollers.
                </li>
            </ol>
            Definitions:
            <ol>
                <li>Punch – Strong enough force applied by a bare hand to create mild contusion on an average
                    21-year-old healthy male.
                </li>
                <li>Environment (Area) – The effective area in space, which the dodging system was designed to monitor.
                    System – The electrical makeup of the robot which involves the specified components.
                </li>
